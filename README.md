# Inter-College Athletics Meet — Scoring System

A production-quality Python application that scores athletics performances using
the **official World Athletics Scoring Tables (2025 edition)**. It reads an
Excel or CSV file of athletes' results, computes each athlete's World Athletics
points, and writes a formatted Excel file with **one row per athlete**, sorted
from highest total score to lowest.

Athletes are identified by the composite key **(NAME, ID, COLLEGE)**. A single
athlete may appear in the input many times (one row per event); the system sums
their World Athletics points across all events into a single total score.

---

## Features

- **Official 2025 scoring tables** — all 26 sheets of the World Athletics
  workbook (82 events per gender: sprints, hurdles, relays, middle/long
  distance, road running, race walking, jumps, throws and combined events).
- **Correct scoring semantics** — track events (lower time is better) and field
  events (higher distance is better) are handled separately, and a performance
  that falls *between* two table entries always receives the **lower** score, as
  the tables require.
- **Men & Women** tables selected automatically from the `GENDER` column.
- **`.xlsx` and `.csv` input** with automatic format detection.
- **Forgiving event names** — accepts both friendly names (`Long Jump`,
  `Shot Put`, `Javelin Throw`) and official codes (`LJ`, `SP`, `JT`, `100m`),
  case- and spacing-insensitive.
- **FAT timing** by default, with a ready-to-enable **hand-timing** conversion
  hook (optional `TIMING` column).
- **Robust validation** — invalid rows (unknown event, bad result, missing
  fields, gender/event mismatch) are skipped, logged, and listed on a separate
  *Rejected* sheet; valid athletes are still scored.
- **Fast** — ~100,000 rows/second; 50,000 athletes score in under half a second.
- **Full audit log** — input file, athlete count, invalid records, output file
  and execution time are written to a timestamped log.
- **Clean, extensible architecture** — the scoring engine is completely
  independent of any UI or file format.

## Installation

Requires **Python 3.10+**.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The only runtime dependency is `openpyxl`.

---

## Usage

Score an input file (writes `<input>_scored.xlsx` next to it by default):

```bash
python main.py examples/example_input.xlsx
```

Choose an explicit output path:

```bash
python main.py examples/example_input.csv -o results.xlsx
```

Other options:

```bash
python main.py INPUT.xlsx \
    --tables data/scoring_tables.json \   # use a specific table file
    --no-rejects \                        # omit the "Rejected" sheet
    --log-dir logs                        # where to write the run log
```

### Input format

| Column            | Description                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `NAME`            | Athlete's name                                |
| `ID`              | Bib / registration id (text; keeps leading 0s)|
| `COLLEGE`         | College / team name                           |
| `GENDER`          | `Male`/`Female`/`M`/`W`/`Men`/`Women`         |
| `EVENT NAME`      | Friendly name or official code                |
| `PERFORMANCE TYPE`| `TIME` or `DISTANCE`                           |
| `RESULT`          | `10.87`, `2:05.31`, `6.72`, `52.35`, …        |
| `TIMING`          | *(optional)* `FAT` (default) or `HAND`        |

`RESULT` accepts plain seconds (`10.87`), `m:s.cc` (`2:05.31`), `h:m:s`
(`1:02:05.3`) for times, and metres (`6.72`) for distances.

### Output

An `.xlsx` workbook with up to three sheets:

- **Results** — one row per athlete, sorted by descending total `SCORE`:

  `RANK · NAME · ID · COLLEGE · GENDER · SCORE`

  where `SCORE` is the sum of the athlete's World Athletics points across every
  event they entered.

- **Details** — the per-performance breakdown behind each total, grouped under
  the athlete (highest-scoring event first):

  `RANK · NAME · ID · COLLEGE · GENDER · EVENT NAME · PERFORMANCE TYPE · RESULT · SCORE`

  (omit with `--no-details`.)

- **Rejected** — every skipped input row and the reason it was excluded
  (only present when rows are rejected; omit with `--no-rejects`).

---

## Regenerating the scoring tables

The compact `data/scoring_tables.json` is produced once from the original
workbook. Regenerate it (e.g. after a tables update) with:

```bash
python -m athletics_scoring.build_tables
# or with explicit paths:
python -m athletics_scoring.build_tables data/source/WA_Scoring_Tables_2025.xlsx data/scoring_tables.json
```

---

## Running the tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
# or, if pytest is installed:
python -m pytest -q
```

---

## Architecture notes

The scoring engine (`scorer.py`) knows nothing about Excel, CSV, argparse or
logging — it operates purely on in-memory dataclasses. This clean separation is
what makes the system easy to extend:

```
loader → validator → scorer → writer
                ↑
             tables (binary-searched)
```

Each event stores its performance thresholds sorted ascending, so a score is a
single `O(log n)` binary search — no per-athlete linear scans.

### How scoring works

1. `RESULT` is parsed to a plain number (seconds for time, metres for distance).
2. The event's direction is applied:
   - **Time**: the score is the points of the *smallest table time ≥* the mark.
   - **Distance**: the score is the points of the *largest table distance ≤* the
     mark.
   Both implement *"between two entries → lower score."*
3. Marks better than the top of a table are capped at the maximum tabulated
   score; marks worse than the bottom score `0`.

## Future expandability

The design leaves clear seams for planned features:

- **Team scoring / college ranking** — `COLLEGE` is carried through every model;
  aggregate `ScoredResult.score` per college.
- **Best Athlete Award** — pick the maximum score per athlete id.
- **Medal tally** — group scored results by event and take the top three.
- **Meet records** — compare each scored mark against a stored records table.
- **Hand timing** — already implemented in `timing.py`; enable via the `TIMING`
  column.
- **Certificates / PDF reports / GUI** — build on top of `ScoringReport`; the
  engine needs no changes.
